Because it is Your account, it is Your job to obtain and maintain all equipment and services needed for access to and use of This Website as well as paying related charges.

Should You believe Your password or security for This Website has been breached in any way, You must immediately notify Us.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>MEMBERSHIPS AND REGISTRIES.</strong></h3>
    <p>
      By registering for an account with Us, You become a “Member” with access to certain password-restricted areas of the Website and to use certain Services and Materials offered on and through the Website (a “Membership”).  Each Membership and the rights and privileges provided to a Member is personal and non-transferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When You register to become a Member, someone from Our team will contact you for an initial consultation and to assist with setting up Your account, selecting a Project, and creating a Registry for Your Selected Project.  Approved Members will receive a personal Registry Page where they can promote their Selected Project and solicit Gifts to benefit the Selected Project.  Your Registry may contain line items that Guests can purchase through the Website as a Gift to You for the benefit of Your Selected Project.  You will be able to edit and customize Your Registry by logging into the Website, and You will be able to share your Registry with third parties to solicit Gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members may terminate their Memberships at any time by selecting the option to delete their account on the edit profile page of the Website, or, if Member has already created a Registry for a Selected Project, by consulting with one of Our team members.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate a Member account, including but not limited to removing Your Registry from the Website, at any time if We, in Our sole and absolute discretion, suspect You may have violated these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether termination is voluntary or involuntary, Gifts purchased from a Registry prior to the effective date of termination are non-refundable.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>GIFTS.</strong></h3>
    <p>
      The following section is applicable to any user of the Website who purchases a Gift.  Any Guest or Member may purchase a Gift through the Website, and if You do, You authorize Us to perform the following Services.  We will: (i) accept and process Your payment for the Gift via a third-party payment processor; (ii) hold the funds received in an escrow account to be released to the Project after the specified wedding date; (iii) remit funds to the applicable Partner for the Selected Project less a service fee of 9% to cover Our processing and handling fees; and, (iv) send payment receipt for Gift to You via e-mail.  You agree that payment for Your Gift cannot be cancelled or refunded once purchase is completed.  By providing a payment method, You expressly authorize Us to charge the applicable fees on said payment method as well as taxes and other charges incurred thereto for payment in full for the Gift.  Should You close Your account, payments already made will be remitted to the Selected Project or a similar Project, in Our discretion.
    </p>
    
    <h3><strong>PARTNERS AND PROJECTS.</strong></h3>
    <p>
      We do not warrant that any Project will actually be completed.  Projects are proposed to us by our Partners, but We have no control over the progress or completion of the Project.  Further, We reserve the right to cancel a Project if the terms of our agreement with the applicable Partner are violated.  Additionally, the applicable Partner may cancel the Project.  If Your Selected Project is cancelled by Us or the Partner, for any reason or no reason, We will promptly notify the Member responsible for the Registry via the contact information We have on file for the Membership.  All Gifts purchased prior to the effective cancellation date are non-refundable, but will be reallocated to another Project of the Member’s choosing.  If a Project is not fully funded, the funds are remitted to the implementing Partner and will be used at their discretion. We will schedule a consultation with the Member to necessitate the selection of an alternative Project.  The Member will still receive periodic progress updates on how the funds were used by the Partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We serve as an intermediary between donors and beneficiaries.  After a Registry has been completed by reaching a predetermined funding goal or deadline (e.g., the wedding date), We will remit payments received for the purchase of Gifts (less any service fees) to the applicable Partner via a predetermined payment method.  We do not warrant that funds will be used for any particular purpose and are not responsible for misuse of the funds by the Partner.  Please be aware, payments for Gifts are non-refundable.  After We transfer the funds to the Partner of the Selected Project, all further dealings are solely between You and the applicable Partner for the Selected Project.  In the event of a dispute between users of Our Website (including but not limited to Members, Guests, Partners, and third parties), You agree that We have no liability to any party with respect to such dispute.  You hereby release Us and Our employees, agents, affiliates, directors, and representatives from all claims, damages, and demands arising from or related to Your use of the Website or Services that may or may not be known, suspected or related to any such disputes.

    <h3><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></h3>
    <h5 class="text-center"><strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully.  It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong></h5>
    <p>
      This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between You and Us.  Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of These Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  We prefer this because We believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.  To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).  You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong></h5>
    <p>
      For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give Us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing to Us at info@heartful.ly the following information: (1)Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of Your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief You seek. If We do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving Your notification, than You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.  You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</strong></h5>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the above, Your or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).  You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at info@heartful.ly the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Us through arbitration. Either way, We will not take any decision You make personally.  In fact, We promise that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with Us.  But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that <strong>any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></h5>
    <p>
      If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings.  The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.  In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Arbitration Award</i> – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Location of Arbitration</i> – You or We may initiate arbitration in either Washington, D.C. or the federal judicial district that includes Your billing address.  In the event that You select the latter, We may transfer the arbitration to Washington, D.C. so long as We agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines You incur as a result of the transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</i> – So long as You place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, We will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, You will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.  In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Us as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong></h5>
    <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.  <strong>If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You.</strong> Neither You, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Jury Waiver</strong></h5>
    <p>
      You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, You and We are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Provision, You and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g.,, the rights to both appeal and  certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Severability</strong></h5>
    <p>
      If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
    </p>

    <h5 class="underline text-center"><strong>Continuation</strong></h5>
    <p>
      This Provision shall survive the termination of Your account with Us or Our affiliates and Your discontinued use of this Website.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, We agree that if We make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), You may reject any such change and require Us to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between Us arises.
