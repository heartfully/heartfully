        <h3 class="c-faq__question mb--small">What is a charitable wedding registry?</h3>
        <p>It’s just like a regular gift registry, but instead of pots and pans, couples are raising awareness and money for a cause that’s important to them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb--large">
        <h3 class="c-faq__question mb--small">What makes Heartful.ly special?</h3>
        <p>Heartful.ly registries feature real development projects and a memorable way to contribute. Instead of  general donations, guests select from gifts that represent real items from that project’s budget.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>It’s specific.</strong>  Heartful.ly connects couples with an actual development project, not only a cause or organization.  In turn, guests are purchasing gifts from a real list of items in the project’s budget. </li>
            <li><strong>It’s educational.</strong> On the couple's registry webpage, guests can learn more about the project and how it works.  During the project’s implementation, a progress update is shared with every generous donor.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>It’s lasting.</strong> The gifts on a Heartful.ly registry are like seeds that will blossom into opportunities of health, hope, and happiness for those in need.
